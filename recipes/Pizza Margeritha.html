    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p></p>
    This margherita pizza recipe is a celebration of simple, fresh ingredients! Juicy tomatoes, basil, and mozzarella cheese top a crisp, chewy crust.
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
            <li><b>Pizza dough, of course!</b>
                We make our own with this pizza dough recipe. 
                It‚Äôs easy to make with ingredients like flour, water, and yeast, and it yields a chewy, delicious pizza crust.
                Of course, store-bought fresh pizza dough works here too.</li>
            <li><b>Canned whole tomatoes</b> ‚Äì
                 You don‚Äôt need fresh tomatoes to make a great margherita pizza. 
                 Instead, you‚Äôll pulse good-quality canned tomatoes into a no-cook homemade pizza sauce with olive oil, garlic, and salt. 
                 San Marzano tomatoes, a sweet variety of Italian plum tomatoes, are traditional here. Use them if you can!</li>
            <li><b>Fresh mozzarella cheese ‚Äì</b>
                 The perfect rich counterpart to the tomatoes and basil.
                  Cut it into thin slices or tear it before topping the pizza.</li>
            <li><b>Fresh basil ‚Äì </b>
                Its fresh flavor takes this pizza over the top! 
                You‚Äôll sprinkle it over the pizza after baking so that it doesn‚Äôt wilt in the oven.</li>
            <li><b>Red pepper flakes ‚Äì</b>
                They add a kick of heat.</li>
            <li><b>And extra-virgin olive oil ‚Äì</b>
                For rich, fruity flavor.</li>
                <li><b>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</b> </li>    
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The first step in this margherita pizza recipe is preparing the tomato sauce.</li>
    <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
    <li>
        Next, stretch the dough. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt have any fancy pizza-making equipment like a pizza peel or pizza stone. A baking sheet works perfectly for this recipe!
    </li>
    <li>
        Dust it with cornmeal and stretch the dough into a large oval.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then, add the toppings. Spread a heaping 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce over the pizza dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges.
    </li>
    <li>This recipe makes extra pizza sauce! Store leftover sauce in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or freeze it for up to 3 months.

        Tip: I like to freeze small portions of the sauce so that I can just thaw enough for one pizza at a time.</li>
    <li>
        Top with the mozzarella‚Ä¶
    </li>
    <li>‚Ä¶and bake! Transfer the pizza to a 500¬∞F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown.</li>
    <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and top it with the fresh basil leaves, red pepper flakes, and a drizzle of olive oil.

        Slice and serve. That‚Äôs it!</li>
